1. In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

Front end is the visual and interactive parts of a website or application, the parts that users see and interact with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Back end is the server-side logic, things like working with databases, APIs, and authentication.
If I were hired for backend programming, I'd be working on:
-connecting the application to a database
-building APIs that the frontend interact with
-handling user login and authentication
-processing data and business logic

2. Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option?

I would try to convince them by telling them that Python is more readable and concise for backend tasks, it is better suited for data-driven applications, APIs and automation. It has excellent frameworks like Flask and Django for web development. It has built in math and utility modules which simplify complex tasks. It is easy to debug and it is great for teams and long-term maintenance. Then list the similarities and differences.
Similaritites:
-both are beginner friendly and widely used
-both use dynamic typing so variables don't need to be declared with a fixed data type
-both are high-level scripting languages which means code is written and executed line by line
-both have large communities and lots of libraries
Differences:
-JavaScript is mostly used for frontend
-Python is used for backend, data analysis, machine leraning, automation
-Python has clearer and more readable syntax, which makes it easier to learn and maintain

3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

Now that I've completed the first exercise and set up my Python environment, I will focus on these three main goals for my achievement.
-I want to learn how to write clean Python code using variables, loops, functions, and conditionals. I want to become comfortable reading and writing small Python scripts on my own.
-Build backend scripts or tools that do something useful like taking user input, processing it, and giving a result. I want to get hands-on with small Python applications to build my confidence.
-I see myself using Python in backend web development after this achievement. I want to understand how Python is used for tasks like handling user data, working with APIs, or automating processes, so I can move forward with real-world projects.
